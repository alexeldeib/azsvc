If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

                            If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

                            This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically
                            shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow
                            can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name
                            of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields
                            is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying
                            the object.

The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
